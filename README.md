Take-home Assessment 8: Huffman

## Background: Huffman Encoding
Huffman encoding is an algorithm devised by David A. Huffman of MIT in 1952 for compressing data to make a file occupy a smaller amount of space. Unbelievably, this algorithm is still used today in a variety of very important areas. For example, mp3s and jpgs both use Huffman Coding.

## Program Overview
In this assignment, you will create classes HuffmanCode and HuffmanNode to be used in compression of data You are provided with a client HuffmanCompressor.java that handles user interaction and calls your huffman code methods to compress and decompress a given file.
